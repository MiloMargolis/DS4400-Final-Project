        "**Problem Statement:** This project develops a binary classification model to predict the redevelopment potential for Boston properties using parcel data. Properties are labels as high potential based on indicators such as low building to land ratios and underutilized FAR and then classified using logistic regression, KNN, and decision trees with the proper training, validation, and hyperparameter tuning to demonstrate overfitting prevention. \n"
